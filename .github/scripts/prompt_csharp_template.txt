Code Review Request
Please review the following C# code changes pushed to the GitHub branch. Focus on identifying potential issues related to code quality, performance, security, adherence to best practices, and unit testing code coverage. In addition to pointing out potential bugs or logical errors, provide actionable suggestions for improvement and highlight areas for possible refactoring.

Code Changes:
{code_content}

Context:
•	Purpose: This code is part of a Blazor WebAssembly-based simple calculator application, designed to implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) while ensuring the UI accurately reflects the results.
•	Specific Requirements:
    o	The application must calculate results with a precision of up to two decimal places.
    o	It must handle edge cases, such as division by zero, by displaying appropriate error messages.
•	Performance Expectations: The code should be optimized for the WebAssembly environment, minimizing unnecessary state updates and ensuring a responsive UI during calculations.
•	UI/UX Considerations:
    o	Review the simplicity and clarity of the user interface.
    o	Offer feedback on input handling, layout, and the display of results to enhance the user experience.
•	Security Considerations: Validate the security of input handling to prevent any potential vulnerabilities, ensuring proper validation of user inputs.
•	Scalability: Ensure the code structure supports future expansion (e.g., adding complex operations) by maintaining modularity and scalability.

Unit Testing & Code Coverage:
•	Review the existing unit tests to ensure they provide sufficient coverage for the functionality, particularly for edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
•	Identify any gaps in test coverage and suggest additional tests where needed.
•	Verify that tests are designed to validate performance and accuracy up to the required two decimal places.
•	Confirm that the tests handle different scenarios that could impact performance, security, or user experience.

Request:
•	Summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the code.
•	Provide detailed recommendations for improvement, including any identified performance, security, logic issues, or testing gaps.
•	Offer suggestions for refactoring, improving code maintainability, and enhancing unit test coverage where applicable.
